#About this Version

This is the development version of the Elementaire theme, reconfigured to work with Omeka 2.0. Be aware that this will probably not work yet, so don't install it unless you are interested in bugfixing. 

#Elementaire Theme

Elementaire is a theme for exhibits made with the Exhibit Builder plugin for the Omeka content management system. It is based on the minimalistic and now-deprecated Basic theme. It is has two styles: one with a top (horizontal) menu, and one with a left (vertical) menu. It is highly customizable, and gives users the ability to change the background image, page color, fonts used, and more. 

#Prerequisites

To use this theme, you must have at least Omeka version 2.0. It has not yet been tested with other Omeka versions. You must also have the corresponding Exhibit Builder plugin installed. 

#Installation 

To install this theme, first make sure you delete any old versions of Elementaire from your Omeka install. Then, download the .zip file of this repository and unzip it to your themes/ directory in your Omeka install. Then, in the exhibits administration view, select the Elementaire theme for your exhibit.
