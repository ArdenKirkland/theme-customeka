In the theme's settings (Admin -> Appearance -> Themes -> Configure), you can set custom values for: \r\n\r\n * Header font and font sizes\r\n * Header background image\r\n * Body font and font sizes\r\n * Body background image\r\n * Colors\r\n\r\n### Colors\r\n\r\nBy changing the two main color settings, Color One and Color Two, you can colorize your entire site. Customize dynamically generates colors for your whole site based on these two colors. \r\n\r\n### Author\r\nWritten by Jonathan Reeve in 2014-15.
